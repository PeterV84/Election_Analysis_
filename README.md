  ## Challenge Overview
  As the first step after struggling with VBA programming, the Python application along with Visual Studio Code was a less confusing task. The biggest issue was debugging for VBA but for Python it was more the alignment of the tabs. The equations and coding seeemed to be more straightforward. Having Visual Studio Code translate and give pointers to the code as your writing is super helpful and requires less a method of trying and failing and more singling out the issue.

  This challenge I felt much more comfortable with and like everything in this class, will need further exploration to fully utlize all the abilities that Python can give.

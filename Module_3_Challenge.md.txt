Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.This code is straightforward enough to be used for any county in any election with the flexibility to increase or decrease the numbers as needed. This Data can be used for consecutive elections to find out which counties votes lean towards a candidate’s party, and how opposing parties can use that information to campaign harder in those counties. If more variables were to be included such as the age of the voters, we could create an even clearer picture of how the counties may vote moving forward and to see what counties are worth campaigning in.
